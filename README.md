# CE1103-S22021
The files uploaded are part of CE1103 Introduction to Computational Thinking NTU for S2 AY20/21.
There are two parts to the module. First half of the sem consists of basic Python programming while the second half consists of basic C programming.
I will upload the C code as the weeks pass and will eventually get to uploading the Python code for the tutorials and lab exercises.
